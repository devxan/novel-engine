# Novel Engine

A web-based low-code choose-your-own-adventure engine with:

- dynamic variables
- choice requirements
- theming
- opinionated demo
- and more!

## Installation

To install the engine, simply clone the repository and start a PHP server in the root directory. The engine is written in PHP and requires a server to run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotargz/novel-engine
cd novel-engine
php -S localhost:80
```

## Usage

To customize the story, simply edit the `story.json` file. The file is a JSON object that contains the story's structure. The engine will read the file and display the story to the user.
